### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to explore how a MACHINE is LEARNING and how can I use my adaptive problem-solving skills to help those ARTIFICAL brains boost their INTELLIGENCE. And yes, if you are HIRING, let's connect. I love contributing to the success of organizations which utilize DATA to decipher growth.

Till date, I have interned at 3 different organizations; including India's Largest Internship Provider, UAE's Leading Financial Exchange House etc. & have delivered 55+ technical talks at International as well as National Conferences, Meetups along with mentoring 85+ Global & Local hackathons, open source initiatives etc.
Alongside this, I also started India's First & Largest Kaggle Days Meetup community in Delhi NCR focusing on Data Science, AI, ML, Kaggle and love to review technical books too.
